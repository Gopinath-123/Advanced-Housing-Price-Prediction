# Advanced-Housing-Price-Prediction
Advanced Housing Price Prediction Model for  Kaggle Competition using a complex dataset.

A Heavy Exploratory data analysis was needed to clean the dataset as it had missing values, new categories in the test dataset which hadn't appeared in the training set.
With a couple of Feature selection techniques, Modelling was done on blend-stack of Several models to improve accuracy.
Submitting this to the Kaggle Competition , I got a Global rank of 619 - of the 4500 entries( got into Top 12%).
